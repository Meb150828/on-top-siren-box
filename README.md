# On Top Siren Box

On Top Siren Box is a desktop app that makes emergency service roleplay a little better. It's a realistic police siren box that sits on-top of your game window, and can activate siren or light functions in-game.

This app was built for the game [ER:LC](https://www.roblox.com/games/2534724415/Emergency-Response-Liberty-County)
